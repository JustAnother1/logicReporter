logic reporter
==============

This tool can read files that contain  the logic levels of a recorded signal. It can then go through the signal and report everything it sees.
This is not a analyzer plug-in and it does not limit itself to just annotating the waveform. This tool is helpful for signal that have a state. Having a state means that the signals history has an influence on the meaning of the following signal.
